# Facial Expression Recognition
## Overview
This is a facial expression recognition project.

We use deep learning methods to achieve facial expression recognition, and the current project integrates the VGGNet model.

We used PySide2 to write a simple GUI for it, you can input a picture to get the position and expression of the face.
